# SFML Static Premake

This repository provides a simple setup to create a SFML application using Premake 5. 
The solution includes two ready to use projects: `App` (an executable) and `Core` (a static library).
All dependencies are already included in this repo (premake5 and SFML 2.6.1).

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Theo-gamedev/SFML-Static-Premake.git
```

### Setting Up the Solution

1. **Run the setup script:**

   Execute the batch file provided in `Scripts/SetupSolution.bat` to generate the solution files:

   This will generate the project files. And you are now done with setting up the project !
